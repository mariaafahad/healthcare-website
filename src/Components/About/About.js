United Hospital Cancer Care Centre is entirely devoted to provide cancer patients with the most effective range of innovative cancer diagnosis and treatment available. It is the first vanguard hospital playing pioneering role in reshaping the cancer care of Bangladesh as it introduced back in 2011 the first PET-CT scanner and Medical Cyclotron to produce FDG (Fludeoxyglucose), the radioactive isotope which is used in PET-CT scan to detect the presence, spread, recurrence and treatment progress of cancer.</h2>
